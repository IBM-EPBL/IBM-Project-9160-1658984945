Early Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease using Machine Learning
Chronic Kidney Disease is one of the prevalent disease with high mortality rate. It is difficult to detect the disease in early stage as it does not show any symptoms in early stage. As machine learning is good at its prediction and analysis, we build a model using machine learning for early detection of chronic kidney disease.
