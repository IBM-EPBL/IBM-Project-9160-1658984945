      <h1>DEFINITION:</h1>
      <p>Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss<br> of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which<br> are then removed in your urine. Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous<br> levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build up in your body.<br>
        In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you might have few signs or symptoms.<br> You might not realize that you have kidney disease until the condition is advanced.<br>
        Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of kidney damage,<br> usually by controlling the cause. But, even controlling the cause might not keep<br> kidney damage from progressing. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure,<br> which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.</p>

      <h1>SYMPTOMS:</h1>
      <p>Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if<br> kidney damage progresses slowly. Loss of kidney function can cause a<br> buildup of fluid or body waste or electrolyte problems. Depending on how severe it is,<br> loss of kidney function can cause:</p>

      <h1>CAUSES:</h1>
      <h2>Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years.<br>

        Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include:<br></h2>
        <p>
        Type 1 or type 2 diabetes<br>
        High blood pressure<br>
        Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli)<br>
        Interstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures<br>
        Polycystic kidney disease or other inherited kidney diseases<br>
        Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers<br>
        Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys<br>
